    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p style="font-size:90%;">
        Rabindranath Tagore FRAS; Bengali: [robind̪ronat̪ʰ ʈʰakur]), also written Ravīndranātha Thākura (7 May 1861 – 7 August 1941), sobriquet Gurudev, was a Bengali polymath who reshaped Bengali literature and music, as well as Indian art with Contextual Modernism in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Author of Gitanjali and its "profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse", he became the first non-European to win the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. Tagore's poetic songs were viewed as spiritual and mercurial; however, his "elegant prose and magical poetry" remain largely unknown outside Bengal. He is sometimes referred to as "the Bard of Bengal".

    <h2>My favourit poem- "The furthest distance in the world"</h2>
    <p align="center" style="font-family:courier;">
      <strong>
      The furthest distance in the world
      <br/>
      Is not between life and death
      <br/>
      But when I stand in front of you
      <br/>
      Yet you don't know that
      <br/>
      I love you
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The furthest distance in the world
      <br/>
      Is not when I stand in font of you
      <br/>
      Yet you can’t see my love
      <br/>
      But when undoubtedly knowing the love from both
      <br/>
      Yet cannot
      <br/>
      Be together
      <br/>
      <br/>

      <br/>
      <br/>
      The furthest distance in the world
      <br/>
      Is not being apart while being in love
      <br/>
      But when plainly can not resist the yearning
      <br/>
      Yet pretending
      <br/>
      You have never been in my heart
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The furthest distance in the world
      <br/>
      Is not
      <br/>
      But using one’s indifferent heart
      <br/>
      To dig an uncrossable river
      <br/>
      For the one who loves you
